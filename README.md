Hangout for teams
=================

This project aims to provide a suite of tools which make team collaboration using Google Hangouts easier. At the moment,
it contains just one tool, which selects a random participant in the hangout who has not yet been selected. This is intended
for use in daily meetings where each participant takes a turn to speak.
